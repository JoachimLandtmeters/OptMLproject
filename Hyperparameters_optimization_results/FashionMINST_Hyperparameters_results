SGD

FCNN
lr = 0.01
test accuracy = 88.7

CNN
lr = 0.001 (0.01 overfits a lot)
test accuracy = 90
------

LBFGS fullbatch

FCNN
history_size = 20 overfits a lot

history_size = 5,10 good but still overfit (when test accuracy stabilizes)
test accuracy = 88

CNN
epochs = 15
Same as FCNN
test accuracy = 91.6

Both converge in 15 epochs
--------
LBFGS minibatch

FCNN

It does not work well with small batches

batch_size = 1024
history_size = 10
(test loss not really converging)
test accuracy = 87.4

batch_size = 4096
history_size = 10
test acc = 86.9
it s the only one that really converges (wrt test loss)

CNN
batch_size = 4096
history_size = 10
test acc = 87.4

-------
SdLBFGS
FCNN
works well
test acc = 87.7

CNN
in only 10 epochs it works well and test accuracy =90.9
We cn try with more epochs
