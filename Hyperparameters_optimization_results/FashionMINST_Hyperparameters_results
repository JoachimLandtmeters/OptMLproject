LBFGS fullbatch

FCNN
history_size = 20 overfits a lot

history_size = 5,10 good but still overfit (when test accuracy stabilizes)
test accuracy = 88

CNN
epochs = 15
Same as FCNN, but without too much overfitting if only 15 epochs are run
test accuracy = 91.6

Both converge in 15 epochs

FCNN

It does not work well with small batches

batch_size = 1024
history_size = 10
(test loss not really converging)
test accuracy = 87.4

batch_size = 4096
history_size = 10
test acc = 86.9
it s the only one that really converges (wrt test loss)

CNN
batch_size = 4096
history_size = 10
test acc = 87.4

CNN
batch_size=1024, history_size=5
Test accuracy = 88.8, no overfit, nice trends of test loss and train loss
